# 0x01. Caching

# Overview
This project focuses on implementing different caching mechanisms in Python. By the end of the project, you should understand various caching strategies such as FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, and LFU, and be able to explain the purpose and limitations of caching systems.

# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you will be able to explain:
- What a caching system is and its purpose.
- Various caching algorithms: FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, and LFU.
- The limitations and trade-offs of different caching strategies.

What a caching system is: A caching system temporarily stores data to avoid repeated retrieval from a slower or more expensive source, improving access speed and performance.
What FIFO (First In, First Out) means: A caching strategy where the first item inserted into the cache is the first one to be removed when the cache reaches its limit.
What LIFO (Last In, First Out) means: A caching strategy where the last item inserted is the first one to be removed.
What LRU (Least Recently Used) means: A caching strategy where the least recently accessed items are removed first when the cache is full.
What MRU (Most Recently Used) means: A strategy where the most recently accessed items are removed first when the cache is full.
What LFU (Least Frequently Used) means: A strategy that evicts the items used least frequently, aiming to keep frequently used data in the cache.
The purpose of a caching system: Caching improves data retrieval speed by reducing access time to data stored in slower storage, enhancing performance.
What limits a caching system: A cache has limited space, and there are trade-offs between performance, complexity, and cache eviction policies.
